    <div class="em">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <h2>Em demo</h2>
      <p>Em is used to describe font sizes relative to their container element.
         Many people use Em because it allows us to change ALL text sizes in the page
         by changing a single CSS value
      </p>
      <p>
        However the problem with Em is that they're hard to reason about
      </p>
      <div class="outer">
        <p class="inner">If .inner div has a size in em, then my size will be relative to .outer font size</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="rem">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <h2>rem demo</h2>
      <p>rem (Relative Em) is used to describe font sizes relative to their container element.
         Many people use Em because it allows us to change ALL text sizes in the page
         by changing a single CSS value
      </p>
      <p>
        We love rem because they're ALWAYS relative to the font-size in html element
      </p>
      <div class="outer">
        <p class="inner">If .inner div has a size in rem, then my size will stil be relative to html's font size</p>
      </div>
    </div>
