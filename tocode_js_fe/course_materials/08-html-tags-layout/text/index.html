            As a "pure" container, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div">div</a>
            element does not inherently represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so 
            it can be easily styled using the class or id attributes,
            marking a section of a document as being written in a different
            language (using the lang attribute), and so on.
